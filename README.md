# Unitcircle2

My oldest surviving source code (circa 1998), written for the TI-85/85 in
TI-Basic.

From the archive:

    Ever in the middle of a test and forget what the sine of 2 pi over 3?
    This program shows you. With a convient graphical interface, this program
    allows you to choose one of the "sweet-16" located on the unit circle.

Included are the original program (``Unitcirc.86p``) which will run on the
calculator, the source code (``unitcirc.tibasic``) & three screenshots.

I no longer have the hardware to test/run it, but was amazed when I found it
in April 2013. As of that date, ticalc.org claimed it had been downloaded
almost 3000 times.

As with all my TI-Basic programs, it was created completely on the calculator
itself, only transferred to the computer to back it up & share with the world.
